# OEC Interview - Fullstack React / .NET

The objective of this assignment is to test your knowledge on some key technologies we use. 

## How to prepare?

To start, read the [Installation.md](Installation.md). This will give you all the required downloads you will need to run the interview question.

## Start

To use docker to develop, run the following command from this folder:
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

- Frontend will load on url `http://localhost:3001`
- Backend will load on url `http://localhost:10010`

## Additional Information

For information outline the existing backend table structure, take a look at [DataModel.PNG](DataModel.PNG) in this folder

More information about the migrations: [migrations.md](./Interview/RL.Data/migrations.md)

# The Task

## Introduction

We have provided a working example of a website that can create a vehicle repair plan by adding individual repair procedures to an initial blank plan. 
The application displays a list of available procedures, and the user can decide and select those that he deems necessary to repair the vehicle. 
In addition, we can assign a person or several people to each procedure added to the plan (in this case: a mechanic, an employee of a repair facility, etc.). 

## Issue description / Bug report

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a new `Plan`
   - This happens when you click `Start` on the home page of the frontend project when it's running.
   - List of procedures available for the plan load are loaded automatically when a plan is created. 
     They will show up in `Procedures` list (left column of the Plan).

1. Add 2 procedures to the `Plan`
   - Procedures are added to a plan when you click a checkbox from the Procedures list on the left side of the plans component.
   - After being added, the procedure checkbox will show up selected along with being added to the Added to Plan list on the right side of plans page
1. Add users to the procedures
   - Select and add 1 User to the first procedure and select and add 2 different Users to the second procedure in the plan
   - User is added to the procedure by selecting it from the "Select User to Assign" drop-down menu below the procedure title.
1.  Refresh the page

Behavior:

- After refreshing the page, the “Select User to Assign” field is empty.

Expected behavior:

- After refreshing the page, the “Select User to Assign” field should display any previously added user.

## Solution notes
1. Create table structure to store the assigned users
2. Create endpoint(s) to interact with new table structure
3. Hook up endpoint(s) to the frontend so when a user is selected, they are correctly assigned to that procedure
